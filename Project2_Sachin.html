    <div class="para">
        <p>Sachin Tendulkar was born to a brahmin family on 24 April, 1973 in Dadar, Mumbai. That is he belongs to
            renowned Saraswat Brahmin Family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi poet and novelist. His mother
            was Rajni who worked in the insurance industry. He has two half-brothers namely Nitin and Ajit and one
            half-sister Savita. His formative years were spent in the "Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society" in
            Bandra (East). He did his schooling from the Sharadashram Vidyamandir High School. In the school days, he
            attended the M.R.F.Pace Foundation to train himself to be a fast bowler. But as per the suggestion of Dennis
            Lillee, the fast bowler from Australia, he concentrated on batting. Sachin Tendulkar also likes playing
            tennis. At the age of 14, he scored 326 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match and became
            famous in Bombay schoolboys.</p>

        <p id="p2">“Beneath the helmet, under that unruly curly hair, inside the cranium, there is something we don't
            know, something beyond scientific measure. Something that allows him to soar, to roam a territory of sport
            that, forget us, even those who are gifted enough to play alongside him cannot even fathom. When he goes out
            to bat, people switch on their television sets and switch off their lives.” &nbsp; — BBC Sports</p>
